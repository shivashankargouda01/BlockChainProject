🌾 Blockchain-Based Agriculture Supply Chain
 Powering Transparency in Food – One Block at a Time 🔗

 📌 Project Overview

This project is a decentralized Agriculture Supply Chain system built using PHP, MySQL, and a minimal blockchain implementation. It ensures product traceability from farmer to consumer by using unique product IDs and blockchain records. Consumers can verify the authenticity and history of a product using a QR code.

🎯 Key Features

- 👨‍🌾 Farmer Module: Add new products with details, assign to sellers.
- 🛒 Seller Module: View assigned products, generate and sell with QR code.
- 🧑‍💼 Consumer Module: Upload/scan QR to view complete blockchain-based product history.
- 🔗 Blockchain Integrity: Each transaction (add/assign/sell) is stored immutably.
- 🔐 User Authentication: Role-based secure login for all users.

⚙ How It Works

1. Farmer Signup/Login→ Add products with details like name, ID, and harvest date.
2. Assign Product to Seller → Farmer assigns product with product ID, seller email, and sold date.
3. Seller Login → Views assigned products and generates a QR code upon selling.
4. Consumer Scans QR → Retrieves entire transaction history from blockchain using product ID.
